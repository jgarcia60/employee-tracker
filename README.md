## Installation

To install the project files, you can clone the "employee-tracker" repository which contains the necessary files at https://github.com/jgarcia60/employee-tracker by clicking the green drop down "Code" and cloning the repo with an SSH key. To run the command line interface app, you will need to run "node server.js" in the correct directory in your terminal. However, the "schema.sql" file should be run in your MySQL GUI first to create the database before connecting it in Node.js.


## Usage 

You may use this code to learn about using the Inquirer npm package to create a command line interface application, or as a tool to learn about using node.js, utilizing "CRUD" queries in MySQL, and more! Check out the video below on how this application works:
